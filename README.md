## How it works

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (server folder)
2. Frontend (web folder)

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)



#### Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:LukasAlves2711/DSMovie.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd dsmovie


# Go to the application folder
$ code .

```
